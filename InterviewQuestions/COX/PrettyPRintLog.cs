/*
We have a Java class that models navigation items for our client websites.
There is a root level item which is not displayed, but contains a list of child items.
These child items may have child items, which may also have child items, to an arbitrary level of depth.
 
Write a method in Java that takes in the root level NavigationItem and prints out the navigation structure in a format that
a non-developer could understand and use to help them troubleshoot issues with a site. You can assume that 
all Lists of children are non-null and have length of zero when they are empty.
 
public class NavigationItem {
   public String url;
   public String label;
   public List<NavigationItem> children;

}
